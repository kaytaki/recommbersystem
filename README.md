# recommender system
If you have tried online shopping, you must have noticed that when you are checking out a product on an eCommerce site, there is a list of suggested products that you are presented with. In this project, I have built a recommendation system to find out the recommended product based on the country.

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing an online retail recommender system I developed using Python and machine learning techniques. This project is based on a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, containing information about online retail products. The goal of the project was to build a recommender system that suggests relevant products to users.

The dataset consists of thousands of records, including features such as invoice no, stock code, description, quantity and more. To ensure the data was suitable for modeling, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing steps. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming the data into a format suitable for training machine learning models.
